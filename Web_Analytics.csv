,Company Background,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Quality Alloys, Inc. (QA)1 is a relatively small (less than $75 million in annual sales) US-
based distributor of different grades of a variety of alloys used in industrial manufacturing.
Its products include, for example, refractory alloys, which have the property of maintaining
strength at high temperatures and are used in furnaces and aircraft turbine engines.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,QA’s market niche is based on a number of factors:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,1,,"It has expert knowledge regarding which suppliers manufacture the different grades
of alloys and those who do so reliability.
It sells in small quantities.
It cuts material to user-specified sizes, with tolerances of less than .001 of an inch.
It ships items in stock the same or next day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"2.
3.
4.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"QA’s customers are generally small companies that make parts out of the alloys they
purchase. They generally can’t buy directly from mills (the alloy producers) as their orders
are not large enough. These customers do not inventory the alloys purchased from QA, and
they typically purchase what they need for specific jobs they have in hand. One purchase
may not be an accurate predictor of future purchases; that is, one purchase may not signal
what will be purchased in the future, or when a future purchase will occur. The individuals
making the purchasing decisions may be engineers, purchasing agents, or the business
owners.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"QA is well-respected in its market space. Its competitors are other intermediaries providing
similar services.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"QA markets its products through direct mail, advertising in trade magazines and, more
recently, via paid listings on two industrial product web portals, GlobalSpec and
ThomasNet. In mid-2008 QA decided to extend its marketing reach by establishing a
company web presence. The goals of the company’s website were to (a) drive new sales, (b)
make product and contact information available, and (c) give or add legitimacy to its brand.
Further, in addition to providing QA with another opportunity for reaching out to its
traditional clients, management thought the website would enable QA to extend its reach to
many more customers in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The Asian market was viewed
as particularly important to QA given the shift towards manufacturing in the Pacific Rim.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Given the intricacies of QA’s products, the website was not designed to allow users to enter
orders over the web. However, in addition to providing descriptions of the products and
services offered by QA, the website does allow potential customers to submit request for
quotations; that is, a request to be contacted. These requests are given to inside sales staff for
follow up. As is the case for other business-to-business (B2B) providers, there’s no direct way
to connect a visit with a sale as there is no “shopping cart” on the website.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"QA commissioned a professionally produced brochure providing an overview of the
company’s products and services and sent it to potential customers in mid-December 2008.
The list of potential customers and their addresses was purchased by QA. The total cost of
the promotion is estimated to be approximately $25K.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"There are a number of questions that would be useful for QA to have answered
investing in further promotional activities. Foremost of these are the following:",,,,,,,,,,,,,before,,


,,,,"How many people visit the website? How do they come to the website?
Is the website generating interest, and does this interest yield actual sales?
Do traditional promotions drive web traffic, and in turn drive incremental sales?
How can visits to the website best be modeled?
Where and how should QA advertise?",,,,,,,,,,,,

,Business Value,,,,,Assessed,,,,,,,,,,

,"While the usefulness of B2B websites in terms of advertising, sales promotion, public
relations, and marketing is generally recognized, valuing B2B websites remains elusive. For
business-to-consumer (B2C) websites, the valuation task is facilitated by the fact that
purchases are typically made via the website. Data can be compiled on sales volume, the
effect of promotions on sales, how website design changes impact sales, etc. For B2B websites
without “shopping cart” functionality the task is considerably more challenging. A principal
conclusion of a Forrester Report on B2B marketing is that “business-to-business (B2B)
marketers collect mounds of data . . . but still struggle to find effective ways to measure and
demonstrate success.” Some 44% of the survey respondents cited “demonstrating ROI” as
the top challenge in managing their website.2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"More generally, there has
investments in information",,,,,,,"been a longstanding debate on the value of organizational
technology (IT). Some have argued that investments in IT are",,,,,,,,

,"closely linked to organizational effectiveness.3 Others, on the other hand, have gone so far as
to argue that “IT doesn’t matter.”4",,,,,,,,,

,Web,,Analytics,,,,,,,

,"QA’s website developer utilized Google Analytics (http://www.google.com/analytics/), a free
web analytics tool so that the site would track, and QA management would have access to, a
wide variety of web metrics. Google Analytics is implemented by putting the appropriate
code, provided by Google, on each web page. The data collected is sent to Google; users, like
QA managers, access it by logging in to their Google Analytics account. Typical metrics
include the number of visitors to a site, the amount of time they spent on the site, the number
of pages viewed, etc.",,,,,,,,,

,"Apart from Google Analytics, QA participated in Google’s AdWords program.5 AdWords
ads are the “sponsored links” that appear next to, and sometimes above, Google search
results. That is, QA paid to have these ads (with links to the QA website) appear on the
Google search result page when relevant search terms (specified by QA) were used.",,,,,,,,,

,Website Visits,,,,,,,,,

,"Figure 1 is a plot of the number of visits to the QA website per week over the period May 25,
2008–August 29, 2009. The start date was the first full week the website was available to
visitors. The end date was selected as it coincided roughly with the launch of another QA
website, which had the potential of affecting the data at the primary website. The time frame
includes the direct mail brochure promotion sent during December 2008.",,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,FIGURE 1. VISITS TO THE QA WEBSITE PER WEEK.,,,,

,"The entire time frame has been divided into four sections. The first comprises the “initial” or
“break-in” period for the website. The second, established when visits appear to stabilize at a
roughly constant level, is the “pre-promotion” interval. The “promotion” period begins",,,,,,,,,

,"shortly after QA’s promotion took place and website visits dramatically increased. The final
period, “post-promotion,” begins when visits appear to level off again. Two points are worth
noting. First, it seems clear from both the data and feedback from QA management that this
general partitioning makes sense. For example, website data through May 2010 (not
provided here) indicate that visits remained approximately at the same level as the post-
promotion period; it can be reasonably assumed therefore that the jump associated with the
promotion period is not due to some seasonal variation or external economic factor. Second,
while there is some arbitrariness about the exact cutoffs between periods, varying them in
any reasonable way does not impact the analysis.",,,,,,,,,

,Assignment,,,,,,,,,

,The Deliverable,,,,,,,,,

,"Your job, as a trusted advisor to QA management, is to examine the value of QA’s website by
tracking not just website metrics (e.g., visitors, pages/visit, time per visit, etc.), but the
associated (non-web-based) financial measures of sales, profit and amount of merchandise
sold. One focus of your efforts should be an analysis for senior management regarding the
effectiveness of QA’s promotional effort.",,,,,,,,,

,"Your report should be submitted in two parts. The first part should be an executive
summary, one to two pages in length. It should summarize results and provide
recommendations to QA managers as to how they might best market their business with an
aim towards improving sales. Your recommendations may rely on your knowledge and
experience beyond the case, but your suggestions must be supported by the data and your
analyses. (You may, and probably should, do additional analyses other than those required
here. You should at least review all the data.) You can use the questions from the Company
Background section of this document on page three as a guide for what your summary
should cover. Finally, note that this is a “real-world” case; that is, depending on your
analysis you may not have all the data you want. You may certainly include as part of your
recommendations that additional data be collected.",,,,,,,,,

,"The second part of your report should be responses to the questions posed in the Analysis
section that follows. Be sure your responses are numbered, corresponding with their
respective questions. There is no need for added verbiage, just your answers to the questions
in order. It’s preferable if this is submitted in Word or .pdf format (like the first part). Excel
printouts are fine as long as they are neatly formatted.",,,,,,,,,

,"You should do the second part

,,DATA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"The data for this case is provided in the Quality Alloys Data spreadsheet. The data is
collected over weekly intervals for the period May 25, 2008–August 29, 2009, unless
otherwise indicated. The number of visits per week, as well as some visit-related information
captured by Google Analytics, is in the Weekly Visits worksheet. (The meaning of each
variable is provided in the glossary at the end of this document.) Financial data, collected via
the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system at QA is provided in the Financials
worksheet. (The revenue and profit variables are self-explanatory; the pounds sold variable
represents the total number of pounds of material sold that week, and the inquiries variable
captures the total number of inquiries received by the sales staff at QA. The records do not
indicate which of these inquiries were generated directly from the website.) The Lbs. Sold
worksheet contains pounds of material sold data over a broader time span, from January
2005–mid-July 2010. (This is the only data collected over a time frame other than May 25,
2008–August 29, 2009.) The Daily Visits worksheet contains, as you might expect, the
number of daily visits to the QA website. Various “demographic” data for site visitors, also
from Google Analytics, is provided in the Demographics worksheet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,Start by getting a better sense of the data in each of the four periods.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"1) Using data in the Weekly Visits and Financials worksheets, create four column charts (like
Figure 1: Visits to the QA Website per Week) for unique visits over time, revenue over time,
profit over time, and pounds sold over time. You do not have to indicate on these charts the
cutoffs for the four periods.
2) Using the same data, calculate the following summary statistics for visits, unique visits,
revenue, profit, and pounds sold: mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and
maximum, for the initial, pre-promotion, promotion, and post-promotion periods. So, for
each period you should provide 25 values: five summary measures for each of five variables,
as per the table below for the initial period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"That is, you should create four such tables, one for each period.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Suggestion: It’s probably easiest to start by copying the data for these five variables to a new
spreadsheet. Then either:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,"a) Use the Descriptive Statistics tool for the data for each period, and then create the
four tables from this output, or",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,"b) Create a (blank) table like the one above to the right of the initial period data. Use
the Excel functions to calculate the summary measures for visits for the initial period.
You can then copy these values across to complete the table for the initial period.
Now create another blank table for each additional period and repeat.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Excel Tip: Descriptive Statistics. You can determine these summary values using the Excel
functions =average(), =median(), =stdev(), =min(), and =max(). You can also get a variety of
summary measures, including these five, by using the Descriptive Statistics option: click on
Data/Data Analysis/Descriptive Statistics.
3) Create a column chart of the mean visits over the four periods—that is, your chart should
have four columns, the first representing the mean visits during the initial period, the second
representing the mean visits during the pre-promotion period, etc. Create four more such
charts, this time using the mean unique visits, mean revenue, mean profit, and mean pounds
sold statistics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Suggestion: Create another (blank) table on the same worksheet that looks like the one
below. Type the cell addresses for the mean visits for each period (that you already
calculated) into the appropriate cells in the first column, then copy these values across to
complete the table. Creating the column charts from this table is straightforward.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"4) Write one or two paragraphs summarizing your findings thus far. Be sure to describe the
behavior of each variable. Indicate what the results seem to show about the relationships
between the variables, and the apparent effect(s) of the promotion. (In the next section you’ll
explore this further; feel free to make any conjectures here that seem reasonable.) Be sure to
support your verbiage with your analysis results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VARIABLES,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Up until now, you’ve analyzed each variable separately. It would seem reasonable to look at
pairs of variables and see what happens to one as the other varies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"5) Start by taking a look at revenue and pounds sold. (Before proceeding, what does your
intuition say about the relationship between these two variables?) Create a scatter diagram of
revenue versus pounds sold. (Revenue should be on the y, or vertical, axis.) Determine the
correlation coefficient of revenue and pounds sold.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Excel Tips: Scatterplots. 1) You begin creating a scatter plot by highlighting two columns of
data. If the columns are not contiguous, you can highlight the second column by holding the
CTRL key down while selecting those cells. 2) By default Excel will place the variable in the",,,,,,,,,,,,,

using the Excel function =correl(range1,range2). For determining correlation coefficients
between sets of variables, it’s easier to use Data/Data Analysis/Correlations.",,,,,,,,,,,

between revenue and number of visits to the website. Feel free to examine any other variable
pairs you think might be important.",,,,,,,,,,,

particular variable appears to be reasonably approximated by a normal distribution, with a
predictable mean and standard deviation, future values for that variable can be reasonably
estimated. The purpose of the following exercise is to pursue this modeling process.",,,,,,,,,,,

,,Some suggestions:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Use the approach given in slide five as an estimate for the class width—you may want to
experiment with smaller or bigger values. (Another rule of thumb for determining the
number of bins is to start with the square root of the number of observations, and adjust
from there.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,This tutorial uses Excel 2003. Use the following modifications for Excel 2007/2010:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"On slide seven, choose Data/Data Analysis (not Tools/Data Analysis).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Replace the steps on slides 13–15 with the following (to reduce the gaps between the bars to
zero): right-click on a bar, choose Format Data Series, set Gap Width to zero, and click Close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"The “fine tuning” suggestions in slides 18 on are optional. However, in Excel 2007/2010 you
should outline each histogram bar in black: right-click on a bar, choose Format Data Series,
Border Color, choose Solid Line, choose black for the color, and then click Close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Another good (video) tutorial using Excel 2010 is at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyxPp22x9PU.
Note that this approach uses two steps to better define the bin widths that appear on
histogram.
c) Describe the histogram. Does it appear bell-shaped?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Generally, simply examining the histogram has limitations for judging how well a data set
follows the normal distribution. (Bear in mind, for example, that while all normal
distributions are unimodal and symmetric, not all unimodal and symmetric distributions are
normal.) An additional approach is to see how well the data follows the Empirical Rule.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"The theoretical number of observations refers to the number of observations in each interval
if the data followed the Empirical Rule exactly. So, calculate the theoretical number of
observations for each interval by multiplying the number of observations in the pounds sold
data set by the theoretical percentage of data in that interval.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑠 𝑠𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜,,,,,,,,


,,"The z-score therefore gives the number of standard deviations an observation is away from
the mean. (For example, if the mean and standard deviation of a data set are 25 and 5
respectively, then an observation of 35 is (35 – 25)/5 = 2 standard deviations away from the
mean.) Once you’ve calculated the z-scores for the pounds sold data, sort the data by the z-
scores. It then becomes straightforward to determine the actual number of observations
within 1, 2, or 3 standard deviations of the mean.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,"Excel Tip: Counting. If you’ve sorted your data by z-score, you can count which
observations are in each category directly. Alternatively, you can use the Excel function
=countif() to count all the entries greater than (>), less than (<), greater than or equal to (>=),
or less than or equal to (<=) some value. For example, if you want to determine the number of
observations in a range that are less than or equal to 1, you can use =countif(range,“<=1”). (Be
sure to include the quotation marks.) You can count all the observations that are between 1
and -1 (inclusive) by using",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"A small amount of text data given to a web browser by a web server. The data is stored on a
user’s hard drive and is returned to the specific web server each time the browser requests a

,"Cookies are used to remember information from page to page and visit to visit, and can
contain information such as user preferences or shopping cart contents, and can note
whether a user has logged in so that they do not need to authenticate again as they navigate
through the site.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,NEW VISITOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Google Analytics records a visitor as ‘new’ when any page on your site has been accessed for
the first time by a web browser. This is accomplished by setting a first-party cookie on that
browser. Thus, new visitors are not identified by the personal information they provide on
your site, but are rather uniquely identified by the web browser they used.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,NO REFERRAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"The “(no referral)” entry appears in various Referrals reports in the cases when the visitor to
the site got there by typing the URL directly into the browser window or using a
bookmark/favorite. In other words, the visitor did not click on a link to get to the site, so
there was no referral, technically speaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

URL if available, any search terms that were used, time and date information, and more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"For the purpose of Google Analytics reports, a session is considered to have ended if the user
has been inactive on the site for 30 minutes. You can update this setting with an addition to
our tracking code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,TRACKING CODE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"The Google Analytics tracking code is a small snippet of code that is inserted into the body of
an HTML page. When the HTML page is loaded, the tracking code contacts the Google
Analytics server and logs a pageview for that page, as well as captures information about the
visit and non-identifying information about the visitor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,UNIQUE VISITOR SESSION,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"A Unique Visitor Session is a visitor interaction with a website for which the visitor can be
tracked and declared with a high degree of confidence as being unique for the time period
being analyzed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,UNIQUE VISITORS (OR ABSOLUTE UNIQUE VISITORS),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"Unique Visitors represents the number of unduplicated (counted only once) visitors to your
website over the course of a specified time period. A Unique Visitor is determined using
cookies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,VISITOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,"A Visitor is a construct designed to come as close as possible to defining the number of
actual, distinct people who visited a website. There is of course no way to know if two
people are sharing a computer from the website’s perspective, but a good visitor-tracking
system can come close to the actual number. The most accurate visitor-tracking systems
generally employ cookies to maintain tallies of distinct visitors.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
